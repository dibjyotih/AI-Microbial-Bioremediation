# AI-Driven Microbial Bioremediation Model for Plastic Waste Treatment in Urban Water Bodies

## Project Overview
This project develops an AI-driven model to identify plastic types in urban water bodies using spectral data and recommend microbes for bioremediation. It processes spectral datasets (single-sample or multi-sample) to classify plastics as PET, PE, or PP, recommends optimal microbes for degradation, and estimates degradation progress over 30 days. The app features a Flask backend for AI processing and a React frontend for user interaction.

## Key Features
- **Plastic Identification**: Classifies plastics (PET, PE, PP) from spectral data using a pre-trained TensorFlow model with heuristic adjustments.
- **Microbial Recommendation**: Suggests microbes (e.g., *Aspergillus flavus* for PET) based on environmental conditions (pH 7.2, temperature 32Â°C).
- **Degradation Monitoring**: Estimates degradation progress (e.g., 24.0% for PET in 30 days).
- **Flexible Input**: Supports datasets with varying numbers of spectral bands (e.g., band1 to bandN).
- **User-Friendly Interface**: React frontend with clear instructions for uploading datasets.

## Requirements
### For Developers/Students Studying the Project
- Basic understanding of Python (Flask, TensorFlow, pandas).
- Familiarity with JavaScript/TypeScript and React.
- Knowledge of Git for version control.
- Interest in environmental science, AI, and bioremediation.

### Software Requirements
- Python 3.8+: For the backend.
- Node.js 16+ and npm: For the frontend.
- Git: For cloning the repository.
- Text Editor: VS Code recommended.
- Operating System: Windows, macOS, or Linux.

## Future Improvements
- Train the TensorFlow model on real spectral data for better accuracy.
- Allow users to input custom environmental conditions (pH, temperature).
- Add support for more plastic types and microbes.
- Improve frontend UI/UX with better visualizations.
